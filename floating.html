                   The oil-on-canvas painting is dominated by a night sky roiling with chromatic blue swirls,
                   a glowing yellow crescent moon, and stars rendered as radiating orbs. One or two cypress trees,
                   often described as flame-like, tower over the foreground to the left, their dark branches
                   curling and swaying to the movement of the sky that they partly obscure.
                   Amid all this animation,a structured village sits in the distance on the lower right
                   of the canvas. Straight controlled lines make up the small cottages and the slender steeple
                   of a church, which rises as a beacon against rolling blue hills. The glowing yellow squares of
                   the houses suggest the welcoming lights of peaceful homes, creating a calm corner amid the
                   paintingâ€™s turbulence.
